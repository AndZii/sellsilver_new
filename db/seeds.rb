    description: "Sterling silver and silver are often described as the same thing. Sterling silver is only an alloy containing 92.5% of fine silver with the remaining 7.5 to 8% from other metals like copper, steel or iron added to stabilize its shape. Because of the high percentage of silver in “pure silver”, it is too soft and cannot hold its shape when making various utensils like forks, knives, spoons, coffee sets and many others. Fine silver is composed of 99.9% pure silver and is used only in silver bullion bars, bullion rounds, and fine jewelry. At Sell My Silver NYC, we buy all types and grades of silver.",

        description: "How are silver coins valued? The best way to calculate the value of junk silver coins and other silver pieces is to determine the amount and grade of fine silver each piece contains. Then we figure out the intrinsic value by checking current market values of the precious metal. In addition, a number of other factors are carefully taken into consideration during appraisal to get you the highest possible value for your silver—age, rarity, condition, collectability, quantity and more.",
